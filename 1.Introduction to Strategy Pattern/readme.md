## Notes

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and seprate them from what stays the same.
2. Always code to interface not implemantation. i.e program to a supertype it can be abstract class or interface
3. Always Prefer composition over inheritance
4. This example demostrates what strategy pattern is -> It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and make them interchangable.Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients using it.
